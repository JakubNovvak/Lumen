<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Lumen will be an Invoice Management System, providing the ability to store, add and managing the flow of the invoices within the company.

The future objective of the development is to:
- Give the option of multiple user levels with different permissions and functionalities
- Admin dashboard - managing, adding, modyfing, deleting and assigning invoices to the users
- Jwt Authentication Based System

The project is designed using standard Client and Server distinction, with the Server side being developed with the microservices approach, utilizing Docker Desktop with Kubernetes. Additionally, a structure of microservice is based on Onion Architecture.
## Current Stage of Development

At the moment, the project is at the stage of designing and adjusting the microservices infrastructure, alongside with the RabbitMQ message broker.
